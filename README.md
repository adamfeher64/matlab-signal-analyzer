This is my diploma project, which was developed within the diploma thesis. My diploma thesis deals with the statistical analysis of data measured over time. For the purposes of statistical analysis, the MATLAB program was used, in which a fully functional project was developed. The project consists of several functions and applications that allow users to effectively view the data from many different angles, thus helping them to achieve the desired results. My thesis also points to the usage of MATLAB in the field of data science.
